    <statement>
        <p>
            Consider a thin bar of constant cross-sectional area that has mass density function <m>\rho(x) = {{function}} </m>, where <m>x</m> is measured in centimeters from the end of the bar and <m>\rho(x)</m> is measured in grams per centimeter. Suppose that the rod is {{length}} centimeters long.
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Write down an integral which computes the total mass of this bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write down an expression involving integrals which computes the center of mass of this bar.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <b>Note:</b> you do not need to compute the integrals! (But you can if you want to.)
