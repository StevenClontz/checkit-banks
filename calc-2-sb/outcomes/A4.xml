    {{#bucket}}

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose a  bucket of water is being pulled into the air by a rope at a constant rate.  The bucket is constantly losing water as it's pulled up, so at a height of <m>h</m> meters, the mass of the bucket is <m>m(h)={{bucket}}</m> kg.  Write down an integral which computes how much work is needed to lift the bucket <m>{{height}}</m> meters into the air. Include units on each factor of your integral.
                </p>
                <p>
                    (Handy hint: the acceleration of gravity is <m>9.8 \text{m}/\text{s}^2</m>.)

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose a cylindrical well filled with water has height {{height}} meters and radius {{radius}} meters.  Write down an integral which computes how much work is needed to pump all the water out of the well. Include units on each factor of your integral.

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose a  trapezoidal dam has height {{height}} feet, top width of {{top}} feet and bottom width of {{bottom}} feet.  Water is pressed against the entire surface of the dam. Write down an integral which computes the force exerted against this dam. Include units on each factor of your integral.
