    <!-- Use slope fields to qualitatively describe the behavior of solutions to differential equations. Identify equilibrium solutions to autonomous DEs. -->
    <statement>
        <p>
            Consider the differential equation <m>\dfrac{dP}{dt} = (P-{{unstable}})({{stable}}-P)</m>.
            <ol>
                <li>Draw a slope field. (You can use technology to help.)</li>
                <li>Find any equilibrium solutions and decide whether they are stable or unstable.</li>
            </ol>

    <!-- The contents of <answer></answer> summarize the
         "final answer" related to this task. -->
    <answer>
        <p>
            The equilibrium solution <m>P(t) = {{stable}}</m> is stable. The equilibrium solution <m>P(t) = {{unstable}}</m> is unstable.
