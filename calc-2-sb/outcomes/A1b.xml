    <statement>
        <p>
            Consider the curve <m>y={{f}}</m>  defined on the interval <m>[{{a}}, {{b}}]</m>.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Set up a definite integral that computes the arc length of this curve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use appropriate technology, such as Wolfram Alpha, to compute this definite integral.
                    (The integrand probably doesn't have an antiderivative!)
                    Report your answer to at least 6 decimal places.

    <answer>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The arc length is computed via <m>\displaystyle\int_{ {{a}} }^{ {{b}} }\sqrt{1+ \left({{fp}}\right)^2}\ dx.</m>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The value of this integral is <m>{{arclength}}</m>.
                </li>
