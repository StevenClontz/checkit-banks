Consider a function of the form <m>f(t) = c \pm a b^t</m>.
By selecting positive constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>
and choosing appropiately from the <m>\pm</m> sign,
give an example* of such a function that has the following properties: 
        </p>
<list>
    <item><p><m>f</m> is always {{creasing}},</p></item>
    <item><p><m>f</m> is always {{concave}},</p></item>
    <item><p>as <m>{{limdir}}</m>, <m>f(t) \to {{lim}}</m>.</p></item> 
</list>
        <p>
Explain how you know that your choices for <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>
produce a function with the correct properties.
        </p>
        <p>
(<em>* Note:</em> there are many, many choices that work; 
you just need to think about the characteristics of the function <m>f</m>
and what you need to be true of <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>.)

        <list>
            <item><p>The <m>\pm</m> must be <m>{{pm}}</m>.</p></item>
            <item><p>We need <m>{{growdec}}</m>.</p></item>
            <item><p><m>c</m> must equal <m>{{lim}}</m>.</p></item>
